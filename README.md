# Causal mechanisms of emergent macrophyte mowing on an aquatic insect community in urban ponds
Urban ponds have the potential to greatly enhance local biodiversity. Despite the importance of macrophyte management in determining aquatic biodiversity, we lack a detailed understanding of how aquatic insects respond to macrophyte mowing, especially the changes in water temperature over time. We conducted paired treatment experiments (with/without mowing emergent macrophytes) from April to September within an artificial wetland in Southeast Asia. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to estimate the causal impacts of macrophyte mowing on aquatic insect diversity and abundance. We found that, overall, mowing significantly increased aquatic insect abundance, but the exact impact varied across families and time. For damselfly larvae (Coenagrionidae), mowing might increase abundance, while midge larvae (Chironomidae) presence decreased. During summer, when water temperature was high, mowing only increased the abundance of midge larvae but not damselfly larvae. On the other hand, during spring and fall, mowing decreased the abundance of both midge and damselfly larvae. In addition, we found that mowing strongly increased the overall water temperature, water pH, and amount of dissolved oxygen; all of which were water quality factors that further impacted the aquatic insect diversity and abundance. Overall, our research revealed the causal mechanisms of mowing emergent macrophytes on an aquatic insect community, and how the impacts varied with water temperature and time in subtropical urban ponds. The findings of this research could be applied to macrophyte management and promoting aquatic biodiversity in urban ecosystems.
